This firmware **REQUIRES** avr-gcc 4.6.2 or later.  It will **NOT** function correctly when built with avr-gcc 4.5.x.  While it is possible to compile it with 4.5.x, it will not function correctly.  You are strongly encourged to use avr-gcc 4.6.2 and avr-libc 1.7.2.  If you move to avr-libc 1.8 or later, you will need to code around deprecated features or add -D__DELAY_BACKWARD_COMPATIBLE__ and -D__PROG_TYPES_COMPAT__ to the compile commands as non backwards compatible changes were made to those facilities in avr-libc 1.8.

Note that with newer versions of gcc, avr-gcc 4.6.2's gtype-desc.c may not compile owing to some incorrect sizeof statements.  Inspection of the code quickly shows the problem.  You can look at the 4.6.3 version of that routine where the issue has been corrected.  Don't use the 4.6.3 version of gtype-desc.c: just fix those five or so mistakes in accord with the 4.6.3 version.

For directions on obtaining and building avr-gcc, please see [http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/install_tools.html].   See the shell scripts in the dist/build-avr-gcc/ subdirectory for suggestions on how to build a tool chain.  The links in those scripts may no longer point at available downloads.  The gcc maintainers eventually remove older tool chains from their repository.
