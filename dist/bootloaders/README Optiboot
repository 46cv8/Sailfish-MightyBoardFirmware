The Optiboot bootloader is an alternate extra small bootloader.

This Bootloader is only 602Bytes long and such extremly limited.
It is mandatory to set the H-Fuse to 0xDE for this bootloader to
operate correctly.

But it allows for reading and writing EEPROM and
reading and burning the Flash except for the Bootloader itself.

But absolutly nothing more is needed in a 3D Printer. So we
have full 3KB more space for teh Main Programm.

As an extra this Bootloader has an extra long (20sec) Bootloader
wait on restart using the RESET Button to make it easier to get
updates flashed. This extra delay is NOT applied on PowerOn.

This Optiboot Bootloader DOES NOT WORK on a mega2560!
